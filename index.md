# General Information

<u>Ultimatum League starts on 4/16/2021 (Patch 3.14)</u>  
Some builds / guides are not new-player friendly and require alot of investment to do endgame content.  Look specifically for New Player / League Start builds for your first character in a League, since everything is significantly more expensive during the first few weeks.

 -  <a href="https://www.filterblade.xyz/" target="_blank">NeverSink Loot Filter</a> (Allows you to set up loot filters in-game to hide useless drops.)
 -  <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum" target="_blank">PoE Official Forum</a> (Traditionally, most build guides are posted within the Classes / Builds forum for each class.  Any thread marked 3.14 are updated for Ultimatum, but most beginner builds for 3.13 should still be relevant.)
